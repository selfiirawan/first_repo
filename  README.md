# 🎮 Rock, Paper, Python! ✊🖐✌

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Python — created as 
part of an exercise while learning Python on Udemy!

It may not be a full custom project from scratch, but it's a fun milestone 
from my learning journey. The goal was to apply basic concepts like user input, 
conditional statements, and using the `random` module in a small interactive game.

## 🧠 What I Practiced:
- Handling user input  
- if/elif/else logic  
- Generating random choices with `random`  
- Looping and replay options

## 🚀 Why I Posted It:
To track my progress, celebrate small wins, and maybe even inspire other 
beginners learning to code. It’s a small game, but a big step forward!

Feel free to try it out or fork it to make it your own! 🎯
